\begin{problem}
Assume that firm $k=1,2, \ldots$ in a competitive industry has $\operatorname{cost} k^{2}+q+q^{2}$ of output level
q. (Here, $k^{2}$ is an escapable cost in the long run.) Then the long run industry saw tooth supply curve has positive output only for prices at least what level?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}[Answer]
Supply of firm $k$ is 
$$MC_k = P \qiq P = 1+2q \qiq q = \frac{p-1}{2}$$
In the long run the fixed cost is escapable thus included in costs therefore firm $k$ has positive supply if:
$$AC_k \leq p \qiq \frac{p^2+4k^2-1}{2(p-1)}\leq p \qiq 4k^2-1\leq p^2-2p$$

The industry has positive output if at least one firm has positive output. We know that firms with higher costs are less likely to produce. The minimum price for which there is at least a firm willing to produce is the price for which $k=1$ is the marginal firm:

$$AC_1 = p \qiq 3 = p^2-2p \qiq \boxed{p=3}$$

\end{proof}

\begin{problem}
Assume a continuum of potential iPhone developers indexed by the quality of their idea. Each developer has a fixed cost of 1 can produce software code according to the function $q=2 \theta x,$ where $x$ is quantity of variable input used by the developer. A unit of software code sells for a price of $1,$ the cost of using a quantity $x$ of the input is $x^{2} .$ The "number" (i.e mass) of firms with ideas above $\theta>0$ is given by $M(\theta)=\theta^{-\beta},$ where $\beta>2$. Apple taxes developers' revenues at a percentage rate $0<\tau<1$.
\begin{subproblem}
    Derive the aggregate supply curve of developer code.
\end{subproblem}
\begin{proof}[Answer]
    Firm $\theta$ produces $q$ units at a cost of 
$$c(q(x)) = x^2 + 1 = \frac{q^2}{4\theta^2} + 1$$

Taking Apple's tax in to account the profits of firm $\theta$ are

$$\pi_\theta (q|\tau) = (1-\tau)q - \frac{q^2}{4\theta^2} - 1$$ 

The optimal production level is:

$$q(\theta|\tau) = 2(1-\tau)\theta^2$$

We know that in the long run firms only produce if they make non-negative profits, this is:

$$(1-\tau)q \geq  \frac{q^2}{4\theta^2} + 1 \qiq 2(1-\tau)^2\theta^2 \geq (1-\tau)^2\theta^2  + 1 \qiq \theta \geq \frac{1}{1-\tau}$$ 

Aggregate supply is given by:

\begin{align*}
2(1-\tau)\int_{\frac{1}{1-\tau}}^{\infty}{\theta^2d(1-\theta^{-\beta})} &= 2\beta(1-\tau)\int_{\frac{1}{1-\tau}}^{\infty}{\theta^{2-\beta-1}d\theta}\\
&= 2\beta(1-\tau) \left(\frac{\theta^{2-\beta}}{2-\beta} \Big|_{\frac{1}{1-\tau}}^\infty \right)\\
  Q(\tau,\beta)&=\frac{2\beta(1-\tau)^{\beta-1}}{\beta-2}
\end{align*}

\end{proof}

\begin{subproblem}
 When Apple raises its tax rate, what happens to the mass of developer firms, and the amount of code each produces?
\end{subproblem}

\begin{proof}[Answer]
If Apple raises it's tax rate from $\tau$ to $\tau'$ where $\tau'>\tau$ then:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\frac{1}{1-\tau} < \frac{1}{1-\tau'} \quad \implies$ the mass of developer firms shrink, i.e. there are firms that where producing before the tax hike that are not producing now.
    \item Form any firm in the market $q(\theta|\tau')=2(1-\tau')\theta^2 < 2(1-\tau)\theta^2 q(\theta|\tau') \quad \implies$ the amount of code produced is lower.
\end{enumerate}


\end{proof}

\begin{subproblem}
What is Apple's revenue maximizing tax?
\end{subproblem}

\begin{proof}[Answer]
Apple tax revenues are given by:
$$R(\tau) = \tau Q(\tau, \beta) = \tau\frac{2\beta(1-\tau)^{\beta-1}}{\beta-2} $$

We know that any increasing transformation of this function will be maximized at the same tax level, then it is easier to take logs and solve:

$$\max_{\tau}\quad \log{(\tau)} + (\beta-1)\log{(1-\tau)} \qiq \boxed{\tau = \frac{1}{\beta}}$$

\end{proof}

\begin{subproblem}
What happens if $\beta$ rises (while $\tau$ is fixed)? Interpret this in terms of firm heterogeneity.
\end{subproblem}
\begin{proof}[Answer]
Recall that the aggregate supply in is:
$$Q(\tau, \beta) = 2\beta(1-\tau)\int_{\frac{1}{1-\tau}}^{\infty}{\theta^{2-\beta-1}d\theta}$$

Suppose that $\beta$ increases to $\beta'$ while $\tau$ remains constant, then:

\begin{align*}
    Q(\tau, \beta) - Q(\tau, \beta') &= 2(1-\tau)\int_{\frac{1}{1-\tau}}^{\infty}{\theta(\beta\theta^{-\beta}-\beta'\theta^{-\beta'})d\theta} \\
    & \geq 2\beta'(1-\tau)\int_{\frac{1}{1-\tau}}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{1-\tau}(\theta^{-\beta}-\theta^{-\beta'})d\theta} \\
    &= 2\beta'\int_{\frac{1}{1-\tau}}^{\infty}{(\theta^{-\beta}-\theta^{-\beta'})d\theta}
\end{align*}

Since $\tau < 1$ then for all $\theta \geq \frac{1}{1-\tau}$ we have that  $\theta^{-\beta}>\theta^{-\beta'}$ therefore:

$$Q(\tau, \beta) > Q(\tau, \beta')$$

As $\beta$ increases firms become more homogeneous (i.e. the mass of "lower" type firms increases disproportionately).

Then the conclusion from this problem would be markets with heterogeneous firms have a higher aggregate output. 

\end{proof}

\begin{problem}
The only Ben and Jerry's in town faces different linear inverse demand curves $P=a-b Q$ for triple-chocolate-chunk ice cream and fruit-bowl-punch ice cream. It buys each at the same constant unit cost from its supplier. The inverse demand curves cross at an interior point, above marginal cost, with Fruit-bowl-punch having a higher price intercept than Triple-chunk. Does it follow that its price charged is higher on the Fruit-Bowl Punch?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}[Answer]

Monopolist faces demands:

$$P_i = a_i - b_iQ_i\quad i = 1,2 \qquad a_1 > a_2$$

Monopolist solve:

$$\max_{Q_i}\: P(Q_i)Q_i - cQ_i \qiq Q_i^* = \frac{a_i-c}{2b_i}$$

Substituting in the demand:

$$P_i = \frac{a_i+c}{2} \qiq P_1 > P_2$$

The monopolist charges a higher price to the product with the higher demand intercept.

\end{proof}

\begin{problem}
There are two groups of Christmas shoppers. Group 2 is gun-shy and hates standing in lines. Group 1 has a lower linear demand, but are willing to take a bullet or stand in line for an hour shopping. Suppose the demands of the two groups are $P_{1}=3-Q_{1}$ and $P_{2}=5-Q_{2}$ respectively, and let $M C=1$ be the firms marginal cost of production. What price should a monopolist charge each group, and how? Suppose, instead that the marginal cost was increasing: $M C=Q$ where $Q=Q_{1}+Q_{2}$, is this problem still separable into two independent optimizations? What price should the monopolist charge to each group?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}[Answer]

If the monopolist can charge separate prices to each group, she will solve the following maximization problems:

$$\max_{Q_1}\:(3-Q_1)Q_1 - Q_1 \qaq \max_{Q_2}\:(5-Q_2)Q_2 - Q_2$$

first order conditions gives:

$$3-Q_1 = 1 \qiq Q_1 = 1 \qaq 5-Q_2 = 2 \qiq Q_2 = 2$$

plugging in to the demand equations we get:

$$\boxed{P_1 = 2} \qaq \boxed{P_2 = 3}$$

Now, if marginal cost is increasing and depends on the total output of the firm, the problem is no longer separable and the monopolist solves:

$$\max_{Q_1,Q_2} \quad :(3-Q_1)Q_1 + (5-Q_2)Q_2  - \frac{(Q_1 + Q_2)^2}{2}$$

first order conditions gives:

\begin{align*}
    Q_1&:\qquad -3 Q_1-Q_2+3 = 0 \qiq Q_1 =\frac{1}{3} \left(3-Q_2\right)\\ Q_2&:\qquad -Q_1-3 Q_2+5 = 0 \qiq Q_2 = \frac{1}{3} \left(5-Q_1\right)
\end{align*}
Solving the system of equations:

$$Q_1 = \frac{1}{2} \qquad Q_2 = \frac{3}{2}$$

plugging in to the demand equations we get:

$$\boxed{P_1 = \frac{5}{2}} \qquad \boxed{P_2 = \frac{7}{2}}$$

\end{proof}
